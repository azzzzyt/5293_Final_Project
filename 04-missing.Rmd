# Missing values

In this part, we want to explore whether there is any missing value pattern in the dataset.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(naniar)
```

```{r fig.align = 'center'}
# import the data
data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Health expenditure and financing.csv")
data <- data[, c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19)]
country <- c("BRA", "CAN", "CHL", "DEU", "FRA", "GBR", "ISL", "MEX", "POL", "RUS", "TUR", "USA")
data <- data %>%
  filter(LOCATION %in% country) %>%
  mutate(TYPE = ifelse(LOCATION %in% c("BRA", "CHL", "MEX", "POL", "RUS", "TUR"), "DEVELOPING", "DEVELOPED")) %>%
  filter(HF == "HFTOT")
# calulate the number of missing values
sum(is.na(data))
# draw the plot
vis_miss(data)
```

From above calculation of the number of data missing, we could find that there is no missing value in the dataset.  

In the above plot, there is no black color block that represents for data missing, which also indicates that in this dataset, there is no missing value.
