# Missing values

In this part, we want to explore whether there is any missing value pattern in the dataset.

Firstly, calculating the number of data missing by `sum(is.na())`, the result is 0, which means that there is no missing value in this dataset.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(naniar)
```

```{r fig.align = 'center'}
# import the data
data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Health expenditure and financing.csv")
data <- data[, c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19)]
country <- c("BRA", "CAN", "CHL", "DEU", "FRA", "GBR", "ISL", "MEX", "POL", "RUS", "TUR", "USA")
data <- data %>%
  filter(LOCATION %in% country) %>%
  mutate(TYPE = ifelse(LOCATION %in% c("BRA", "CHL", "MEX", "POL", "RUS", "TUR"), "DEVELOPING", "DEVELOPED")) %>%
  filter(HF == "HFTOT")
# draw the plot
vis_miss(data)
```

In the plot above, there is no black color block that represents for data missing, which also indicates that there is no missing value in the dataset.
